# feedback APP
*Simplification is our vision.*<br><br>
We want to revolutionize the way meetings and events are held today! We will create a platform for speech-to-text notes taking and giving feedback to the speaker. We want ours to become the service of choice for taking notes automatically instead of on paper or on laptops, and for giving feedback to advertisers and publishers. <br><br>
We want to mass market it to anyone wishing to receive feedback or take notes, particularly from speech:business professionals, professors, students, event organizers, media publishers and advertisers for real-time feedback: TV shows like presidential and other debates, online feedback to soap operas, TV ads, etc. <br><br>
Think of all business events or University courses you have attended: Forget consolidating meeting minutes or writing down what the speaker says! Taking notes automatically from the speech and giving real-time feedback to a publisher is the next technological evolution. Think also of meetings with specialists like doctors or lawyers where understanding language makes it difficult to follow them: Notes taking becomes a simple task and they are available for later review.
